# Stylistic Multi-Task Analysis of Ukiyo-e Woodblock Prints

## Ukiyo-e Woodblock Print Dataset

The Ukiyo-e woodblock print dataset extracted from ukiyo-e.org can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/13120879). This directory includes both the original raw metadata, and the processed metadata for all 175.000+ images. For the experiments, the artworks with a missing/ambiguous date were filled using a uniformly sampled date from the the artwork's era of creation. This upsampled dataset can be found in the 'experiments' folder.
